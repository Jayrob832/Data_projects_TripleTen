Summary

The spreadsheet provides an in-depth analysis of rental trends across various New York City neighborhoods. Key insights include:

•	Neighborhood Preferences:

o	Midtown: There is a clear preference for rentals that require fewer bedrooms, such as studios, suggesting a niche market for compact and efficient living spaces.

o	Hell’s Kitchen: The data shows a higher demand for 2-bedroom units, making it a strong market for slightly larger living spaces.

•	Overall Demand Patterns:

o	The top 10 neighborhoods—Lower East Side, Hell’s Kitchen, Harlem, Midtown, Upper West Side, Chelsea, East Village, East Harlem, West Village, Upper East Side, and Nolita—reveal diverse offerings.

o	Rental activity peaks on Fridays, indicating that timing can play a role in market strategy.

•	Size of Properties:

o	There is consistently lower demand for larger properties with 3 or more bedrooms, suggesting that targeted efforts should instead focus on properties that align with the trending sizes.
