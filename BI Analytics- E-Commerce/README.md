### Conclusions

Chinese cuisine dominates as the most popular option, with several restaurants ranking among the top-grossing businesses. Domino's stands out as the highest revenue earner overall, aided by its multiple locations and global brand recognition. Interestingly, many businesses like Kwality Walls and Natural Ice Cream boast impressive 4.9 ratings with over 1,000 reviews but fail to rank among top revenue earners. Pizza proves to be a customer favorite, appearing in 4 of the top 11 restaurants, highlighting its widespread demand across various venues. On average, ratings across establishments sit at 3.4, while average sales by address amount to 6.5k, reflecting notable trends in consumer preferences and business performance.


### Recommendations

While high sales figures might be achieved, as seen with Domino’s, there remains untapped potential in enhancing brand experience and fostering customer loyalty through better reviews and engagement. Diversifying offerings by expanding into Indian/Chinese combos or incorporating high-margin dessert and beverage options could also provide balance and attract a broader customer base. Furthermore, businesses like Janta Snacks and Happy Brew Cafe, which boast strong average sales despite moderate ratings, highlight the need to address potential inconsistencies in service or product quality to sustain long-term success.
